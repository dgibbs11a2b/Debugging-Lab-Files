Here is a description of each Python program, its respective file name, and its intended purpose.
1.	branching.py – This program asks the user for input of year of origin that the time traveler was from. If the time traveler is from the year 1900 or prior to that, the program responds with “Whoa, that’s the past!”. If they originated from a year greater than 1900 or less than 2020, the program responds with “Far out, that’s the future!”.
2.	collection.py – This program will print the authors who are assigned to the “authors =” variable, along with the date that they died, and it will then format them and display them to the screen in this format: “FirstName LastName” died in “Year”
3.	grading.py – This program will add three test scores together, produce the average of those scores, and then produce a letter grade and indicate whether the student is passing based on this information.
4.	pirate.py – This program will prompt the user to input a password. If the greeting is. Inputting “Arrr!” will prompt the program to display “Go away, pirate”. All other passwords entered will prompt the program to display, “Greetings, hater of pirates!”
5.	time.py – This program will ask the user for the current time, then asks the user how long it should wait. It will then calculate the current wait time and the number of hours that have passed based on your current time entry. Then it will produce the results on the screen.
